//Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it. 
//Every worker has a name and a salary rate. 
//Write method ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker. 
//A Daily Worker is paid on the basis of the number of days he/she works. 
//The Salaried Worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are. 
//Test this program to calculate the pay of workers. 
//You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism to write this program.
