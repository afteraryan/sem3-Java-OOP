EXPERIMENT â€“ 3

 

1.     Write a program to accept three digits (i.e., 0 - 9) and print all its possible combinations. 

(For example if the three digits are 1, 2, 3 than all possible combinations are : 123, 132, 

213, 231, 312, 321.)

2.     DONE: Write a Java Program to accept 10 numbers in an array and compute the square of each number. Print the sum of these numbers.

3.     DONE: Write a program to input a number of a month (1 - 12) and print its equivalent name of 

	the month. ( e.g 1 to Jan, 2 to Feb. 12 to Dec.)

4.     Done: Write a program to find the sum of all integers greater than 40 and less than 250 that are divisible by 5.
